                        I’m a junior graphic designer with a flair for colour
                        and an eye for the bold and beautiful
                    </p>

                        Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the
                        countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind
                        texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at
                        the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A
                        small river named Duden flows by their place and
                        supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a
                        paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of
                        sentences fly into your mouth. <br /><br />
                        Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the
                        blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day
                        however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem
                        Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The
                        Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were
                        thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious
                        Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She
                        packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt
                        and made herself on the way. <br /><br />
                        When she reached the first hills of the Italic
                        Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of
                        her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
                        Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.
                        Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she
                        continued her way.
